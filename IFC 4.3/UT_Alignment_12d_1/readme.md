# Simple alignment with horizontal geometry and no vertical geometry
# There is only the semantic definition and no ifc geometry 

### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment consisting of a:
 Horizontal Geometry: straight, an arc with ifc positive radius of curvature, and a straight
 Vertical Geometry:   there is no vertical geometry

In the ifc file there is the seamantic definition of teh alignment but no ifc geometry.

The Ifc file UT_Alignment_12_1.ifc was generated by 12d Model - Dec 2020. 

Note: 
Peter Bonsma's program EnrichIFC4x3 was used to create a file with ifc geometry from the semantic definitions  

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon following other scenarios:

- None

### Content

This scenario covers the following concepts and/or IFC entities:

- IfcAlignment
- IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment - PredefinedType LINE
- IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment - PredefinedType CIRCULARARC with positive RadiusOfCurvature

### Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:

| Filename                           | Description                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UT_Alignment_12d_1.ifc`           | the exported content as an IFC file                                                              |
| `UT_Alignment_12d_1.png`           | plan and long section view of the alignment, and the segment parameters (with Civil radius)      |
| `UT_Alignment_12d_1_Enriched.ifc`  | the original ifc file but with ifc geometry added using Peter Bonsma's (from RFS) Enrich program |
