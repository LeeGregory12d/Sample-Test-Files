# UT_Alignment_12d_3
# Simple alignment with left arc in horizontal geometry and crest parabola for vertical geometry
# There is only the semantic definition and no ifc geometry 

### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment consisting of a:
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
 Horizontal Geometry: straight, an arc with ifc positive radius of curvature, and a straight
=======
 Horizontal Geometry: straight, an arc with ifc positive radius of curvature 150, and a straight
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
 Vertical Geometry:   straight, a crest parabola, and a straight

In the ifc file there is the seamantic definition of the alignment but no ifc geometry.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The Ifc file UT_Alignment_12_3.ifc was generated by 12d Model - 19 Dec 2020. 
=======
The Ifc file was generated by 12d Model - 23 Dec 2020.
