# UT_Alignment_12d_9
# Alignment with partial clothoid of decreasing radii between two left arcs. No vertical geometry
# There is a start chainge of 1000.
# There is only the semantic definition and no ifc geometry 

### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment consisting of a:
 Horizontal Geometry: left arc, partial clothoid of decreasting radii, left arc
 Vertical Geometry:   No VG

In the ifc file there is the seamantic definition of the alignment but no ifc geometry.

The Ifc file was generated by 12d Model - 24 Dec 2020. 


### Prerequisites

- This scenario builds upon the scenario UT_Alignment_12d_6 (non zero start chainage)

### Content

- This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

It has a partial clothoid
