# UT_Alignment_12d_8
# Alignment with start chainge of 1000, left arc in horizontal geometry and crest and sag parabolas for vertical geometry
# There is only the semantic definition and no ifc geometry 

### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment consisting of a:
 Horizontal Geometry: start chainage of 1000
                      straight, an arc with ifc positive radius of curvature, and a straight
 Vertical Geometry:   straight, a crest parabola, a straight, a sag parabola and a straight

In the ifc file there is the seamantic definition of the alignment but no ifc geometry.

The Ifc file was generated by 12d Model - 25 Dec 2020. 


### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the scenario UT_Alignment_12d_7 but with a start chainage of 1000

My uderstanding is that nothing will change in the IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment's
because their sttribute 3, StartDistAlong, is only measured from the start of the horizontal 

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

IfcAlignmentHorizontal - Attribute 8 StartDistAlong = 1000
