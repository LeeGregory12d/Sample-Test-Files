# UT_Alignment_12d_11
An alignment example where in Civil speak, the vertical geometry (VG) starts after and ends before, the horizontal geometry(HG)

Or in ifc speak where geometry has a different meaning:
An alignment example where vertical segments start after and end before, the horizontal segments.

Alignment with partial clothoid of decreasing radii between two left arcs, and vertical
There is a start chainage of 0.

In the ifc file there is the semantic definition of the alignment (horizontal and vertical segments) but no ifc alignment geometry.

## Intent
IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment consisting of a:
 Horizontal segments: left arc, partial clothoid of decreasting radii, left arc
 Vertical segments:   the vertical segments starts after the horizontal segments
                      and stops before the end of the horizontal segments      
There is no ifc geometry for the alignment.

The Ifc file was generated by 12d Model

## Prerequisites
This scenario builds upon the scenarios
- UT_Alignment_12d_9

## Content
This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:
- the vertical segments start after the horizontal sements and stops before the end of the horizontal segments.  

## KIT Checking Tool
One error
- missing ViewDefinition but ViewDefinition is not yet defined in the standard

Note: the IfcAlignment.Axis was fudged because even though there is no ifc alignment geometry, IfcAlignment.Axis is compulsory

## Supporting files
Following files correspond to this scenario:
