# UT_Alignment_12d_2
 Simple alignment with left arc in horizontal and crest arc for vertical
 There is only the ifc semantic definition and no ifc geometry 

## Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment consisting of a:
 Civil Horizontal Geometry: straight, an arc with ifc positive radius of curvature, and a straight
 Civil Vertical Geometry:   straight, a crest arc, and a straight

In the ifc file there is the ifc semantic definition of the alignment but no ifc geometry.

The Ifc file was generated by 12d Model - 2 February 2021. 


## Prerequisites

- This scenario builds upon the scenario UT_Alignment_12d_1

## Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

- IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment - PredefinedType CONSTANTGRADIENT
- IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment - PredefinedType CIRCULARARC for crest

## Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:
