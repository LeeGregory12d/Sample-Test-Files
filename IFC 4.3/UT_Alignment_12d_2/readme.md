# UT_Alignment_12d_2
# Simple alignment with left arc in horizontal geometry and crest arc for vertical geometry
# There is only the semantic definition and no ifc geometry 

### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment consisting of a:
 Horizontal Geometry: straight, an arc with ifc positive radius of curvature, and a straight
 Vertical Geometry:   straight, a crest arc, and a straight

In the ifc file there is the seamantic definition of teh alignment but no ifc geometry.

The Ifc file UT_Alignment_12_2.ifc was generated by 12d Model - 19 Dec 2020. 


### Prerequisites
