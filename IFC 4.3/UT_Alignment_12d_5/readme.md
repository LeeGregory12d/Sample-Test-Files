# UT_Alignment_12d_5
# Alignment with left and right arc and left and right leading and trailing clothoid transitions in horizontal geometry
# No vertical geometry
# There is only the semantic definition and no ifc geometry 

### Intent

Unit Test using IFC 4x3 RC2

This scenario is an alignment consisting of:
 Horizontal Geometry: straight of length 38.292,
                      leading left clothoid transition of length 20 with ifc positive radius of curvature going from 0 to 150,
                      left arc of length 74.118 with ifc positive radius of curvature 150,
 					  trailing left clothoid transition of length 30 with ifc positive radius of curvature going from 150 to 0,
					  straight of length 14.9,
                      left arc of length 12.45 with ifc positive radius of curvature 40,
			          straight of length 47.26,
					  leading right clothoid transition of length 10 with ifc negative radius of curvature going from 0 to -75,
                      right arc of length 26.798 with ifc negative radius of curvature -75,
 					  trailing right clothoid transition of length 30 with ifc negative radius of curvature going from -75 to 0,
					  straight of length 54.426
					  
 Vertical Geometry:   no vertical geometry

In the ifc file there is the semantic definition of the alignment but no ifc geometry.

The Ifc file was generated by 12d Model - 24 Dec 2020. 


### Prerequisites

  This scenario builds upon UT_Alignment_12d_4

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

  IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment - PredefinedType CLOTHOID with negative radius of curvature
  IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment - PredefinedType CIRCULARARC with negative radius of curvature


### Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:

|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UT_Alignment_12d_5.ifc`           | the exported content as an IFC file                        |
| `UT_Alignment_12d_5.png`           | plan view of the alignment and table of segment parameters |
