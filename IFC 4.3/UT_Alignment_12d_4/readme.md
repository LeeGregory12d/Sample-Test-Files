# UT_Alignment_12d_4
# Alignment with left arc and leading and trailing clothoid transitions in horizontal geometry
# and no vertical geometry
# There is only the semantic definition and no ifc geometry 

## Intent

Unit Test using IFC 4x3 RC2

This scenario is an alignment consisting of:
 Horizontal Geometry: straight,
                      a left clothoid transition with ifc positive radius of curvature going from 0 to 150,
                      a left arc with ifc positive radius of curvature,
 					  a left clothoid transition with ifc positive radius of curvature going from 150 to 0,
					  and a straight
 Vertical Geometry:   no vertical geometry

In the ifc file there is the semantic definition of the alignment but no ifc geometry.

The Ifc file was generated by 12d Model - 24 Dec 2020. 


## Prerequisites

  This scenario builds upon UT_Alignment_12d_1

## Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

  IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment - PredefinedType CLOTHOID with positive radius of curvature
